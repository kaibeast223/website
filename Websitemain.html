<p>Welcome to my website here I will be uploading a bunch of stuff i do with programming all of this code for the website and stuff is on github which is most likely where you got this. Hope you learn and enjoy some of the stuff i show you</p>
<p>This first project that i will be attempting is gonna be to use some html to create a fun website.Well a functional one</p>
<p>the project will be started soon but here is some prerequisites stuff.</p>
<p>this is gonna be using<br>the break<br>function</p>
<pre>This is a pre function this changes the font/type of font to help older computers render</pre>
<p style="color:green">this is green text!!</p>
<p style="color:red">This color is gonna be red!!!</p>
<p style="color:blue">This works by using a style function in side of the p in bracket thingy at start you do style-"color-red" </p>
<p style="font-family:courier">Im fancy.... using instead of color its style="font-family:courier"</p>
<p style="font-size:200%">Im bigger than you uses style="font-size:200%"</p>
<p style="text-align:center">if you have ocd than use style="text-align:center"</p>
